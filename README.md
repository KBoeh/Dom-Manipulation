# Dom-Manipulation
Reskill Americans Assignment <br>
Bootstrap 4 styling was used for this simple layout. <br>
Using JavaScript, text was added to the HTML document and a button (on click) adds text to a textbox. <br>
The background color of 5 elements was also changed by using the querySelector() and setAttribute() methods to change the Bootstrap class names. <br>
